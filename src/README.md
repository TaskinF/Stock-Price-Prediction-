# Project Overview
In the world of finance, stocks represent ownership shares in corporations, and they are traded on stock exchanges. These stock markets provide a platform for buying and selling stocks, as well as other financial securities like bonds. The value of stocks is influenced by numerous external factors, making stock price forecasting a challenging task. However, through the application of machine learning models and advanced data visualization techniques, it becomes possible to make more informed investment decisions.

Our project aims to develop a web application that leverages machine learning models to provide visualizations and forecasts for stock prices. By doing so, we seek to assist investors in making data-driven choices when it comes to their stock investments. In addition, we will adopt an Agile approach, ensuring that our project remains flexible and adaptable, allowing for iterative development and quick responses to changing requirements. This project combines the power of data science, technology, and an Agile methodology to enable more informed and strategic investment decisions.
